# Quote Generator

This is a JavaScript quote generator project that fetches quotes from an API and provides the functionality to tweet the quote on Twitter. In case the API link doesn't work, the project also includes a separate JavaScript file with local quotes. A new quote is generated every time the "New Quote" button is pressed.

- Click the Twitter icon to open Twitter and tweet the quote
